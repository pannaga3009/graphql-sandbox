## Apollo GraphQL Overview

Apollo GraphQL is a powerful framework for building GraphQL applications that allows you to efficiently manage data across different sources. Here are some key components of Apollo GraphQL:

1. **Request**: When a request is made, it contains a GraphQL query that defines the structure of the data needed.

2. **Query Validation**: The query will be validated against a predefined schema. This ensures that the query structure adheres to the rules set out in the schema.

3. **Resolver**: The resolver is responsible for handling the validated query. It contains the code that will be executed to fetch the requested data from an API or a database.
